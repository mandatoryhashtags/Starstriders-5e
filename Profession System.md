# Profession System
In Starstriders you take on the role of a adventurer trekking across the stars, you are not heroes per se but some people may consider you as such. Starstriders do the work that must get done in the galaxy, even if no one wants to talk about it. Bounty hunting, murder for hire, corporate espionage, smuggling, piracy, all of these and more are done by Starstriders every moment of every day throughough the known galaxy.

You are one of those Starstriders. But who were you *before* you becamse a furious Android Barbarian, or cunning Rogue?

> Game Designer: To be clear. Class only advances by Milestone. The Profession system ***COMPLETELY*** replaces the skill system in 5e. The combat and skill system do not cross paths except in *very* unusual circumstances like an opposed Athletics check which is completed as normal with some added numbers (3d6 + Ability Modifier + Skill Ranks). Your proficiency modifier never gets applied to skills unless you have the Expertise feature (see below).

Your profession is often separate from your Class. A class represents combat training. Your profession represents what your character did before they took on a role as a Starstrider. Throughout the game you will get Professional Development Points to spend to increase the skills of your character. Gamemasters tend to do this after enough sessions it is warranted but a good rule of thumb is every odd level (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19) you get get 5 Professional Development points to spend on your skills.

Put simply: Class comes into play in Combat just following 5e rules. Profession comes into play outside combat more skill based (and also starship combat).

> Game Designer: If something says you get Advantage on a specific kind of check from your class add +3 to those checks. If something says you get Expertise such as a Rogue you just get to add your proficiency modifier from your class to your skill checks which you normally cannot do.


No starting character can have more than 6 ranks in any skill. If you get choices to go over that number pickup a specialization or a different skill in your list.

## Species Skills
* Skills: Culture (your species) +2, History (your species) +2, World Knowledge (your homeworld) +2

## Backgrounds
Write down whatever label you want for your background. Fold it into your backstory. Were you Orphaned as a child? Put that in there and pick skills that make sense for an Orphaned Child. Work with your gamemaster. The removal of "Background Features" is replaced by the addition of a FEAT.

### Background Features
* Pick 1 Skill at +2
* Pick 3 Skills and add +1 to them
* Pick 1 Feat

> Game Designer: What do 5th Edition backgrounds all have in common? No one cares. I have played 5th edition since its inception and DM'd over 2000 hours of it and I have almost never seen someone *use* their background feature. But feats like Lucky? Every day.

## Professional Development
Profesional development represents what career your character had (and in some cases may still do). If there is not one that suits your character vision work with your gamemaster to make one. While there is not one for Rimworld Lawkeeper or a Computer Slicer, your gamemaster could definitely assist you in coming up with what that looks like.
